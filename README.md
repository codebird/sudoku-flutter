# 🧩 Flutter Sudoku

A clean, ad-free Sudoku game built with Flutter.  
This project was born out of my frustration at not finding a Sudoku app on the Play Store that didn’t bombard me with ads — so I decided to make my own.

- Smooth, responsive gameplay
- Classic Sudoku rules and mechanics
- Cross-platform support (Android, iOS)
